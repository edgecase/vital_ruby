# PROJECT A: Conference Scheduling

## Goals

* Design and build a full Ruby program

## Discussion

Given:

1. a set of presentations (in the same format as the
   "<code>presentations.txt</code>" file from [lab 4](voting.html))
   and

1. A number of time slots

1. A number of tracks

Write a program that will assign presentations to a track and a time
slot so that:

* No individual speaker is assigned more than once to a time slot.

* The number of different categories in a single time slot is
  maximized.  (i.e.  If there are a number of iPhone talks, put them
  in different time slots so that an attendee mainly interested in
  iPhone development can see as many talks as possible)
